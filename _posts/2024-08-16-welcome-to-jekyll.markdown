There is actually nothing to see here. But, here is some information about the project.

OT Lighthouse is a project to help ICS / OT administrators with hardware / software asset management, vulnerability assessment, information gathering, regulatory compliance, and system hardening. The focus of this project is to address standalone workstations, servers, and smaller ICS / OT deployments. The code and capabilities provided in this project are developed using community input, administrative implementation, and information gathering during cybersecurity assessments.

The origins of this project are based on the following projects. OT Lighthouse is intended to centralize these disparate efforts.

You can find the source code for Minima at GitHub:
* [Configuration Hardening Assessment PowerShell Script (CHAPS)](https://github.com/cutaway-security/chaps)
* [Stand-Alone Windows Hardening (SAWH)](https://github.com/cutaway-security/sawh)
* [NERC CIP Assessment Scripts (NCAS)](https://github.com/cutaway-security/NCAS)

You can other open source efforts for the ICS / OT community at the [Cutaway Security GitHub](https://github.com/cutaway-security).
